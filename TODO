# TODO

Last revised 2014-5-8.

[X] add a database backend to store noid state
[X] add support for config files. Mainly to store database credentials and simplify writing of init scripts.
[X] change noid service to guarantee no duplicates. (Currently, state is flushed to disk every 5 seconds).
[X] Add `-version` command line switch
[ ] create a log rotate config for spec file and decide on a default log place /opt/noids/log/...
[ ] create an upstart config for spec file
[X] should rpm put file at /opt/noids to satisfy our local procedures.
    /opt/noids/1.0.1/bin/...
    /opt/noids/current -> /opt/noids/1.0.1
    /opt/noids/log/...
    /opt/noids/config
    /opt/noids/pools/...
[X] Get default port from Mark (13001)
[X] Choose a default storage directory /opt/noids/pools/...
[ ] Tag versions in github.
[ ] Standardize the naming: a noid _counter_ belongs to a _pool_, etc. (this may already be done...)
[ ] Look at https://github.com/rcrowley/go-tigertonic for better (?) logging, metrics,
[ ] Add an information page in server to return the version, response times, and counts of error codes
