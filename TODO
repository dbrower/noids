# TODO

Last revised 2020-11-30

[X] add a database backend to store noid state
[X] add support for config files. Mainly to store database credentials and simplify writing of init scripts.
[X] change noid service to guarantee no duplicates. (Currently, state is flushed to disk every 5 seconds).
[X] Add `-version` command line switch
[X] Tag versions in github.
[ ] Standardize the naming: a noid _counter_ belongs to a _pool_, etc. (this may already be done...)
[ ] Look at https://github.com/rcrowley/go-tigertonic for better (?) logging, metrics,
[ ] Add an information page in server to return the version, response times, and counts of error codes
